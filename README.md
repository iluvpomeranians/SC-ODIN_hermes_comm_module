# SC-ODIN_hermes_comm_module
----
Communications Module for SC-ODIN Hermes ground-station software. 

Skills: IMGUI · Libcsp · C (Programming Language) · C++

A part of a small software development team responsible for communications, monitoring and proper functioning of the SC-ODIN CubeSat scheduled to launch in December 2022. The payload is a hyper-spectral imaging camera that will capture AOD (aerosol optical depth) images over Argentina and Namibia. 
My role is to help develop a GUI communications terminal module for the SC-ODIN satellite ground station software. The application is coded in C++ and graphically renders by integrating the IMGUI interface library. The module will be composed of a console, logger, as well as other diagnostic data that will communicate using a combination of CSP (CubeSat Space Protocol) and a custom UART serialized encoded layer.A part of a small software development team responsible for communications, monitoring and proper functioning of the SC-ODIN CubeSat scheduled to launch in December 2022.
